    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Karma Yangchen, and I am currently studying at Samtse College of Education under the Royal University of Bhutan, pursuing a Bachelor of Education. I am passionate about becoming a teacher and believe in the power of education to inspire and transform lives. Through my studies, I have learned to combine technology and creative methods to make learning engaging and effective.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of my academic life, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me motivated and energized. I enjoy reading adventure books and novels, which expand my imagination and give me new perspectives on life. I also love traveling, as it allows me to explore new places, cultures, and ideas. Dancing is another passion of mine, giving me joy, energy, and a creative outlet to express myself.</p>
    
    <p>These interests help me develop important personal qualities like discipline, creativity, and perseverance, which I apply in my studies and projects. I am always eager to learn, grow, and use my skills and experiences to make a positive impact in both my academic journey and the community around me.</p>
